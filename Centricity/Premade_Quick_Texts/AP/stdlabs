As we discussed, we will check a full panel for STD's including HIV, hepatitis, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and trichomonas. Until these results come back, please do not have sex including oral sex. If these results are abnormal I will contact you. If the results are normal, the medical assistant will contact you unless you specify otherwise.
