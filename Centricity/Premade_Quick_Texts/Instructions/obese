The keys to weight loss include eating healthy foods in reduced portions, daily moderate to intense exercise (to the point of breaking a sweat or bringing your heart rate above 120 beats per minute) for more than 30 minutes every day, and avoiding sedentary activities (staying still in the same place like a couch, chair, etc)/staying active throughout the day. If you would like to meet with a nutritionist, we would be happy to help facilitate this.
