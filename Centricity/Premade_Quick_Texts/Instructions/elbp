Blood pressure can be elevated when we are acutely ill. When feeling well again, monitor blood pressure at pharmacy.  If regularly elevated >130/90, return to clinic for discussion of antihypertensive management.  In the meantime, blood pressure can be reduced by decreased salt intake, and if relevant-- decreased (if not discontinued) alcohol and cigarette use, if applicable.
