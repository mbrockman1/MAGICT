As we discussed, stopping smoking can be difficult and can take the average smoker 5-7 attempts to quit. There are two addictions to battle with: the chemical addiction (which we can prescribe medications for) and the physical/behavioral addiction. Resources that can help with the behavioral/physical addiction include: talking with friends and family, making a stop date and formulating a plan to stop, and utilizing the ASH line (1-800-55-66-222).
